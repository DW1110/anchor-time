# AnchorWatch

An iOS app that alerts you if your anchor is dragging

> **Heads Up!** This app is still very much a work in progress. Check out the [open issues](https://github.com/bkeepers/anchor-watch/issues) if you would like to contribute. 

## Mockups

These are some initial mockups of how the app will work. These will be updated with real screenshots when the app fully functional.
